# Introduction
This research aims to identify the factors that contribute to the popularity of certain instant ramen brands. Instant ramen, known for its convenience and comfort, is a staple food for many. By understanding the key elements that make some ramen brands highly rated, manufacturers can improve their products.

We analyzed three datasets with a total of 33,393 observations, focusing on aspects like brand, variety, style, country, and stars. Our findings revealed that the top ramen-producing countries are predominantly Asian, with the United States being the exception. High-rated brands (4 stars and above) come from countries like France, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore.

Using TF/IDF, we identified common flavor descriptors such as spicy, soup, curry, chicken, and sauce, which are prevalent among popular ramen varieties. Additionally, we examined the correlation between packaging and popularity, concluding that "pack" style packaging is the most favored.

Our research explores how brand origin, flavor variety, and packaging impact ramen ratings, providing insights into consumer preferences in the ramen noodles market.
